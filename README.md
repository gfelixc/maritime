- UNLOC refers to the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE). Which is a [five-character code system](https://uncefact.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=17830748) that provides a coded representation for the names of ports, airports, inland clearance depots, inland freight terminals and other transport related locations which are used for the movement of goods for trade.
